== Description ==
Transforms the WooCommerce related and upsell columns into carousels for the [Total WordPress theme](https://total.wpexplorer.com/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'product-carousels-for-total' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use the Customizer settings to control how many items display for the related and cross-sell sections as you will want to display more items than the default so that the carousel works as expected. For example if you want to display 4 columns of related products you may want to set the related items to display at least 8 products.
4. Check your WooCommerce products to make sure the carousels are working.
